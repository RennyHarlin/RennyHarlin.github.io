## Hello and Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

I've just given my blog a fresh new look! Here are some of the improvements I've made:

### âœ¨ New Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Click the moon/sun button in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark themes
- **Smaller Profile Picture**: No more giant profile image - it's now a more reasonable size
- **Improved Typography**: Better spacing and readability throughout the site
- **Responsive Design**: The site now looks great on mobile devices too
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Better focus indicators and semantic markup

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Improvements

The new design focuses on:

- **Readability**: Improved line spacing and typography
- **User Experience**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Modern Look**: Clean, contemporary styling with dark mode support
- **Performance**: Optimized CSS for faster loading

### ðŸš€ What's Next?

I'm planning to write more about:

- Web development tips and tricks
- Programming challenges and solutions
- Technology reviews and insights
- Personal projects and learnings

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the new look! Feel free to toggle between light and dark modes to see which you prefer.
